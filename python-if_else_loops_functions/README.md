# Python Control Flow, Loops, and Functions

## Project Overview

This project covers essential Python programming concepts, including control flow tools, loops, and functions. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain and use these concepts effectively in your Python programs.

## Resources

### Read or Watch:
- More Control Flow Tools (Read until “4.6. Defining Functions” included)
- IndentationError
- How To Use String Formatters in Python 3
- Learn to Program 2: Looping
- Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code

### Man or Help:
- `python3`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General
- **Importance of Indentation in Python**: Understand why proper indentation is crucial in Python and how it affects code execution.
- **Using `if` and `if...else` Statements**: Learn how to control the flow of your program using conditional statements.
- **Comments**: Know how to add comments to your code for better readability and maintenance.
- **Variable Assignment**: Learn how to assign values to variables.
- **Using `while` and `for` Loops**: Understand how to iterate over sequences and perform repeated actions.
- **Break and Continue Statements**: Learn how to control loop execution using `break` and `continue`.
- **Else Clauses on Loops**: Understand how to use `else` clauses with loops.
- **The `pass` Statement**: Learn what the `pass` statement does and when to use it.
- **Using `range`**: Understand how to generate sequences of numbers using `range`.
- **Functions**: Learn what functions are and how to define and use them.
- **Return Values**: Understand what happens when a function does not use a return statement.
- **Scope of Variables**: Learn about variable scope and how it affects your code.
- **Tracebacks**: Understand what tracebacks are and how to read them.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Learn about arithmetic operators and how to use them in Python.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- **Editors**: Allowed editors are `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`.
- **Execution**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.*
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README.md**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- **Code Style**: Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*) guidelines.
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable.
- **File Length**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## Usage

To run the Python scripts, use the following command:
```bash
./filename.py
