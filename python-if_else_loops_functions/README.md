## Positive anything is better than negative nothing

**0-positive_or_negative.py:** `0-positive_or_negative.py`

This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

## The last digit

**1-last_digit.py:** `1-last_digit.py`

This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

## The alphabet game

**2-print_alphabet.py:** `2-print_alphabet.py`

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

## Alphabet soup

**3-print_alphabt.py:** `3-print_alphabt.py`

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

## Hexadecimal printing

**4-print_hexa.py:** `4-print_hexa.py`

Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

## 00...99

**5-print_comb2.py:** `5-print_comb2.py`

Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

## Inventing is a combination of brains and materials

**6-print_comb3.py:** `6-print_comb3.py`

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

## islower

**7-islower.py:** `7-islower.py`

Write a function that checks for lowercase characters.

## To uppercase

**8-uppercase.py:** `8-uppercase.py`

Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

## There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes

**9-print_last_digit.py:** `9-print_last_digit.py`

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

## a + b

**10-add.py:** `10-add.py`

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

## a ^ b

**11-pow.py:** `11-pow.py`

Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value.

## Fizz Buzz

**12-fizzbuzz.py:** `12-fizzbuzz.py`

Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
